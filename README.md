# Zomato Restaurant Performance Analysis (Python & Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Zomato restaurant data to understand how customer experience, pricing, and service features influence restaurant performance.

The goal is to help Zomato identify:
- High-performing restaurant categories  
- The impact of online ordering and table booking  
- How pricing affects customer ratings

## Key Business Questions Answered
- Do restaurants with online ordering receive higher ratings?  
- Does table booking improve customer satisfaction?  
- Which restaurant types perform best?  
- Is higher pricing associated with better ratings?

The Power BI dashboard provides:
- KPIs for average rating, total votes, and pricing  
- Interactive filters for restaurant type and service options  
- Visual analysis of cost vs ratings and customer engagement  

This allows business users to explore performance drivers in real time.
